# Facemask-detction-webapp-using-flask
As the technology are blooming with emerging trends the availability so we have novel face mask detector which can possibly contribute to public healthcare. The architecture consists of MobileNet as the backbone it can be used for high and low computation scenarios. In order to extract more robust features, we utilize transfer learning to adopt weights from a similar task face detection, which is trained on a very large dataset. We used OpenCV, tensor flow, keras, and CNN to detect whether people were wearing face masks or not. The models were tested with real-time video streams. The accuracy of the model is achieved and, the optimization of the model is a continuous process and we are building a highly accurate solution by tuning the hyper parameters.
Thus, this proposed system will operate in an efficient manner in the current situation when the lockout is eased and helps to track public places easily in an automated manner. So, the system would improve public safety by saving time and helping to reduce the spread of the virus..
